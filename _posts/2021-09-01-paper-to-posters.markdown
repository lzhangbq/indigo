Directed Study Project at CMU.


This project aims to create fine-tuned
poster layout annotation datasets. Moreover, we implemented the pipeline to funetune the pre-trained LayoutTransfomer Model on the poster dataset to generate reasonable lay-
outs for academic posters.

My work:
- Created a layout dataset of academic posters through [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) (MTurk).
- Devised bounding box annotation instructions of academic papers and annotated over 500 posters.
- Developed an end-to-end tool to generate posters
from paper.
- Finetuned the [LayoutTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14615) model to 
generate poster layouts.
