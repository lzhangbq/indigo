<p>Directed Study Project at CMU.
This project aims to create fine-tuned
poster layout annotation datasets. Moreover, we implemented the pipeline to funetune the pre-trained LayoutTransfomer Model on the poster dataset to generate reasonable lay-
outs for academic posters.</p> 
<p>My work:
    <li>Created a layout dataset of academic posters through <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> (MTurk). </li>
    <li>Devised bounding box annotation instructions of academic papers and annotated over 500 posters.</li>
    <li>Developed an end-to-end tool to generate posters
from paper.</li>
    <li>Finetuned the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14615">LayoutTransformer</a> model to 
generate poster layouts.</li>
