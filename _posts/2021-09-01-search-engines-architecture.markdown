Course Project at CMU.

This project aims to design and implement large-scale, distributed search engines, including statistical characteristics of text, representation of information needs and documents, several important retrieval models, and experimental evaluation.

My work:
- Developed software architecture components including the design and implementation of large-scale, distributed
search engines over 588,000 documents in dataset.
- Committed 3k+ lines of Java code to implement exact-match and best-match retrieval algorithms.
- Applied SVM ranking framework and diversification approaches to refine the quality of retrieved queries and improve the performance of the search engine by 30%
