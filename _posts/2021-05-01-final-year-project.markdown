HKUST Undergraduate Final Yesr Project 

This project was supervised by Prof. Yangqiu Song. 


My work:
- Constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph framework of COVID-19 related information from medical articles
- Designed entity extraction and relation extraction pipelines through pre-trained NER model and OpenIE
- Committed 4k+ lines of Python code to retrieve over 21,000 entities and relations with the accuracy of over 85% in
the evaluation and stored them in MongoDB by Graphic User interface
- Built a frontend web application including Search Engines and Graphin API by React and Node.js to visualize the backend data to make over 30 clusters.
