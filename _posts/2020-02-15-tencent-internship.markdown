Completed at Tencent, Beijing, China.

In this internship, I have worked in News Client Group to work on Tencent News Recommendation System.

My work:
- Co-developed and improved a 4k-line News Article Recommendation BERT Framework with Python and Pytorch for Tencent News Client Platform used by 100,000+ users.
- Collected and pre-processed over 200,000 articles using Spark and SQL, and optimized the performance of extracting similarities between articles through embedding vectors by performing stopwords filtering through Pytorch, which increased the accuracy of TFIDF by 10%.
- Developed Heatmaps by Python to visualize the result from generating similar articles.
